UPI Payment Link Debug Checklist (Check One-by-One)
1️⃣ Check UPI ID Format

Ensure UPI ID looks like: username@bankname

No spaces

All lowercase

Confirm the UPI ID exists and is active

Try sending ₹1 from any UPI app manually to confirm it works

2️⃣ Ensure merchant information is correct (optional but recommended)

If you added:

tn=some+note
mc=1234
tr=order123


Then check:

tn (transaction note) is under 50 characters

mc (merchant code) should be removed unless you are a registered merchant

tr (transaction reference) should be unique (but optional)

If unsure → remove extra parameters, keep only mandatory: pa, pn, am.

3️⃣ Check the Amount Format

Must be numeric: am=100

No currency symbols

No commas

No decimal errors (am=100.00 is ok, but 100,00 is wrong)

4️⃣ URL Encoding Issues

Make sure the link is properly URL-encoded.

Examples of common mistakes:

Space → %20

& inside text not encoded

+ sometimes breaks UPI apps

👉 Use a URL encoder for full safety.

5️⃣ HTTP vs HTTPS

If you're redirecting from your HTML page → must be HTTPS

PhonePe rejects non-secure redirects

6️⃣ Hidden Characters / Copy-Paste Errors

Sometimes invisible characters break the URL.

Check for:

newline

unicode spaces

trailing spaces in the link

7️⃣ PhonePe-specific requirements

Some UPI apps are strict:

PhonePe requires these to be valid:

pa is correct and active

pn is not empty

am is present (if sent from merchant)

PhonePe sometimes rejects:

merchant code when not verified

missing pn

extra random parameters

8️⃣ Test in two ways

❗Open link from a browser

❗Paste the upi://pay?.... directly into PhonePe "Search Bar"

If one fails and one works → the issue is encoding/redirect.

9️⃣ Try with a minimal UPI link

Use a very clean version first:

upi://pay?pa=yourupi@bank&pn=YourName&am=10&tn=Test


If this works → your expanded parameters are wrong.

🔟 Verify with Google Pay

If GPay works but PhonePe fails:

PhonePe validation is stricter

Remove extra params

Re-encode URL
